# JenkinsECS-Cluster

``Installing Jenkins cluster for CI / CD pipeline``

We want to make a scalable, recoverable Jenkins build cluster which does its capacity planning according to the scalability rule that we define during creation. What it means is we are trying to make a build pipeline which does its own capacity planning, will take a minimum manual effort to setup/recover and is leveraging the cloud services of AWS.
